# SakuraChan
A Discord Bot that currently responds to basic commands and uses the Riot API to retrieve Summoner Information to retrieve their rank and LP

Was done for me to learn simple Node.JS, practice some basic python and to learn how to use API's.

I have removed the Token and API key so it won't work unless those are put in.

It is also missing the Node Module sinced Github doesn't allow uploading more than 100 files at once. So it will need to be setup on the users computer.
